  "output": "**MEMORANDUM**\n\n**TO:** Head of Treasury, Chief Financial Officer\n**FROM:** Treasury Risk Analyst\n**DATE:** 2025-07-01\n**SUBJECT:** **Liquidity Risk Analysis and Stress Test for INR Cash Flow (01-Jul-2025 to 10-Jul-2025)**\n\n---\n\n### 1. Executive Summary\n\nThis report assesses the company's INR liquidity position for the upcoming 10-day period from July 1st to July 10th, 2025.\n\nThe initial opening balance across all accounts is **\u20b91,002,145**. While the base cash flow forecast suggests a stable position, it appears dangerously optimistic as it omits significant, known fixed payments.\n\nStress testing reveals a **High Risk** of a liquidity shortfall. A severe but plausible scenario combining corrected fixed payments with an unexpected, un-hedged foreign currency payment results in a projected cash deficit of **-\u20b9844,847.89 on July 8th, 2025**.\n\nImmediate action is required to review the forecasting methodology and arrange for short-term credit facilities to mitigate this potential shortfall.\n\n### 2. Opening Liquidity Position\n\nThe analysis begins with the total available cash-on-hand as of the morning of July 1st, 2025.\n\n*   **ACC1001:** \u20b9500,002\n*   **ACC1002:** \u20b9357,843\n*   **ACC1003:** \u20b9144,300\n*   **Total Opening Balance:** **\u20b91,002,145.00**\n\n### 3. Risk Scenario Development\n\nBased on an analysis of historical data and fixed payment schedules, I have identified key vulnerabilities. The following three risk scenarios will be used to stress test our liquidity.\n\n*   **Scenario 1: Fixed Payment Realignment:** The provided cash flow forecast does not account for several large, recurring payments scheduled within the forecast window (e.g., Payroll, Annual Microsoft License, Loan EMI). This scenario corrects the forecast by incorporating these known, non-discretionary outflows.\n\n*   **Scenario 2: Unexpected Supplier Payment:** Historical transaction data reveals large, ad-hoc debits (e.g., debits exceeding \u20b9250,000). This scenario simulates a single, urgent payment of **\u20b9250,000** to a critical supplier on **July 7th**, reflecting operational volatility.\n\n*   **Scenario 3 (Severe Stress): Adverse FX Movement & Urgent Purchase:** The company has a history of USD transactions. This scenario simulates an urgent, un-hedged requirement to pay **$15,000 USD** on **July 8th**. We assume an adverse spike in the USD/INR exchange rate to **86.0** (from a hypothetical base of 83.5), resulting in a sudden outflow of **\u20b91,290,000**.\n\n### 4. Adjusted Cash Flow Forecasts\n\nThe table below details the impact of these scenarios on our daily cash position. All scenarios are cumulative to model a cascading risk event.\n\n| Date       | Base Forecast | Scenario 1 Adjustment (Fixed Payments) | Scenario 2 Adjustment (Supplier) | Scenario 3 Adjustment (FX Shock) | **Adjusted Net Flow** (Scenario 3) |\n| :--------- | :------------ | :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------- |\n| 2025-07-01 | \u20b9-61,955.39   | -                                      | -                                | -                                | **\u20b9-61,955.39**                          |\n| 2025-07-02 | \u20b918,421.74    | -\u20b950,000 (Payroll)                     | -                                | -                                | **\u20b9-31,578.26**                          |\n| 2025-07-03 | \u20b9-27,678.02   | -\u20b9103,000 (Licenses & Transport)       | -                                | -                                | **\u20b9-130,678.02**                         |\n| 2025-07-04 | \u20b9-1,429.62    | -\u20b98,000 (Azure License)                | -                                | -                                | **\u20b9-9,429.62**                           |\n| 2025-07-05 | \u20b9-16,366.34   | -\u20b915,000 (Loan EMI)                    | -                                | -                                | **\u20b9-31,366.34**                          |\n| 2025-07-06 | \u20b9-7,866.95    | -                                      | -                                | -                                | **\u20b9-7,866.95**                           |\n| 2025-07-07 | \u20b9-12,703.31   | -                                      | -\u20b9250,000                        | -                                | **\u20b9-262,703.31**                         |\n| 2025-07-08 | \u20b9-9,951.31    | -                                      | -                                | -\u20b91,290,000                      | **\u20b9-1,299,951.31**                       |\n| 2025-07-09 | \u20b9-11,517.26   | -                                      | -                                | -                                | **\u20b9-11,517.26**                          |\n| 2025-07-10 | \u20b9-10,626.20   | -                                      | -                                | -                                | **\u20b9-10,626.20**                          |\n\n### 5.

Standard operational outflows.\n    2.  Inclusion of omitted fixed payments (Payroll, Licenses, EMI), which reduces the buffer by over \u20b9176,000.\n    3.  A large, unplanned supplier payment of \u20b9250,000 further depletes cash.\n    4.  The critical event is a large, un-hedged USD payment of \u20b91,290,000, which exhausts all remaining liquidity and creates a significant deficit.\n\n### 6. Final Risk Report & Recommendations\n\n**Overall Risk Assessment: HIGH**\n\nThe company's liquidity is vulnerable to a severe shortfall due to a combination of forecasting inaccuracies and exposure to operational and market risks. The historical risk flag `[20250711_110056] Risk: yes` indicates that the system is prone to such events, and our analysis confirms this vulnerability. Relying on the base forecast would be irresponsible.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.  **Immediate (Next 24 Hours):**\n    *   **Revise Forecast Methodology:** The cash flow forecasting process must be immediately updated to automatically incorporate all confirmed fixed payments from the payment schedule.\n    *   **Secure Credit Facility:** Initiate discussions with our banking partners to secure a short-term overdraft or credit line of at least **\u20b91,500,000** to act as a buffer for the forecast period.\n\n2.  **Short-Term (Next 1-2 Weeks):**\n    *   **Implement Cash Pooling:** Consolidate balances from ACC1003 and potentially ACC1002 into the primary operating account (ACC1001) daily to manage liquidity centrally and efficiently.\n    *   **Review FX Exposure:** Identify all significant, un-hedged foreign currency payables scheduled for the next 30-60 days.\n\n3.  **Medium-Term (Next 1-3 Months):**\n    *   **Develop Hedging Policy:** Establish a formal FX hedging policy that mandates the use of forward contracts or options for any single currency exposure exceeding a defined threshold (e.g., $10,000 USD).",
